## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Application Security

#### Frontend Security
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)** implementation
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** protection
- **Input validation** and sanitization
- **Secure authentication** and session management
- **XSS protection** mechanisms

#### Backend Security
- **Helmet.js** for security headers
- **CORS configuration** for cross-origin requests
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- **Input validation** and parameterized queries
- **Secure error handling** (no information leakage)

#### Browser Extension Security
- **Content Security Policy** for extension
- **Permission minimization** (only required permissions)
- **Secure communication** with backend services
- **Input sanitization** for user data

#### Python Services Security
- **FastAPI security features**
- **Input validation** with Pydantic models
- **Secure file handling** for uploaded images
- **Environment-based configuration** for secrets

### Infrastructure Security

- **HTTPS/TLS encryption** for all communications
- **Environment variable** management for secrets
- **Secure API key** storage and rotation
- **Database security** (if applicable)
- **Docker security** best practices

### Development Security

- **Dependency scanning** for known vulnerabilities
- **Code review** process for all changes
- **Secret scanning** to prevent accidental commits
- **Security testing** in CI/CD pipeline

## 🔍 Security Testing

We encourage security testing and welcome reports from:

- **Security researchers**
- **White hat hackers**
- **Academic researchers**
- **Bug bounty hunters**

### Scope

**In Scope:**
- All ThreatPeek components (Frontend, Backend, StegnoShield, Extension)
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Data validation and sanitization
- API endpoints and their security
- Browser extension security
- Cross-component communication security

**Out of Scope:**
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical attacks
- Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
- Issues requiring physical access to devices
- Issues in third-party services we don't control

### Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

**DO:**
- Report vulnerabilities privately first
- Provide detailed reproduction steps
- Allow reasonable time for fixes
- Work with us to minimize user impact

**DON'T:**
- Access or modify user data without permission
- Disrupt our services or other users
- Publicly disclose before we've had time to fix
- Perform testing that could harm users or data

## 🏆 Recognition

Security researchers who responsibly report vulnerabilities will be:

- **Publicly credited** (if desired) in our security advisories
- **Listed in our Hall of Fame** (coming soon)
- **Acknowledged** in release notes
- **Considered for bounties** (if we implement a bug bounty program)

### Requirement 2.1 - 2.4 (Context Preservation)

- ✅ **2.1**: Preserve highest confidence score among duplicates
- ✅ **2.2**: Preserve most severe severity level among duplicates
- ✅ **2.3**: Include occurrence count in deduplicated finding
- ✅ **2.4**: Preserve all unique file locations where pattern was found

### Requirement 3.1 - 3.4 (Performance and Error Handling)

- ✅ **3.1**: Complete deduplication within 5% of original scan time
- ✅ **3.2**: Use memory-efficient deduplication algorithms
